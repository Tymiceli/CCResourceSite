# Data for bootcampers site

The cc/doc site is for _**publicly shared**_ documents useful to coderscampus bootcamp students - nothing proprietary can be found on this site.

Everything here is content published [on this site](https://ccfbase.web.app/)

If you need it [here is more information on what is acceptable on this site](https://github.com/petecarapetyan/cc/blob/main/doc/privacy/HOW_TO_KNOW_IF_OK.md).

This site is for contributions from Java Bootcamp students. 

## Data here is copied to an SSR site

This repository is used to feed content into the bootcampers Knowledge Base. Content could still be viewed here, but that is not the intention.

## A Markdown Site

Primary content on this site is Markdown, or files ending in `.md` and following the markdown standard.

Pull requests are accepted from cc students when they meet the conditions required.

## Images

All images go in `/images/` so name your files with a date or some other unique string to make sure it doesn't clash with another image file name.


Images must be [squooshed](https://squoosh.app/) to less than 100k before being accepted in a Pull Request.

Or, squoosh it down to 3k if it still works! You'd be surprised what you can do with super small images.

If you have never squooshed an image before you need to learn anyway. I also do my own batch squooshing in (ImageMagick)[https://imagemagick.org/index.php] but that takes a while to learn, so you're on your own for that. Or ping me.

## Link Reliability - ahem

The reliability of links for data on this site is probably going to be lame, at least for 2022.

Why? Because we won't really have an understanding for the folder schema until we use if for a year or so.

#### What to do about changing links

When you link to these docs, always know that the links could change.
