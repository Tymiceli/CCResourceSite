# cc/doc repository

The cc/doc site is for _**publicly shared**_ documents relating to coderscampus - nothing proprietary can be found on this site.

## A Markdown Site

Primary content on this site is Markdown, or files ending in `.md` and following the markdown standard.

Pull requests are accepted from cc students when they meet the conditions required.

## Naming Conventions

All files on this site are named like [THIS_HERE.md](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43224835/regex-to-match-all-capital-and-underscore) such as `HELLO_WORLD.md`

This is a convention roughly used for READ_ME files generally, if that matters to you as a rationale.

## Folder Conventions

All files except images on this site are persisted in the `/doc/some/logical/yada/here/` folder, yet to be determined excepting the `/doc/` portion which is not flexible.

If you wish to make a pull request but are not sure where to put the `.md` file, simply put it in `/doc/pete/to/decide/later`

All images go in `/images/` so name your files with a date or some other unique string to make sure it doesn't clash with another image file name.

## Images

Images must be [squooshed](https://squoosh.app/) to less than 100k before being accepted in a Pull Request.

If you have never squooshed an image before you need to learn anyway. I also do my own batch squooshing in (ImageMagick)[https://imagemagick.org/index.php] but that takes a while to learn, so you're on your own for that. Or ping me.
