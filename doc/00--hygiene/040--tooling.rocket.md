# IDEs, shells, editors

Trevor will demonstrate an optimal path, in the video lessons:

- using defaults
- assuming a windows computer
- keeping things as straightforward as possible

The benefits of this approach cannot be understated. By limiting your options you are also greatly limiting your distractions. You stay on track, and remained focused on the task at hand

## Defaults

Assumptions
- windows operating system
- notepad++ for html, css, data
- eclipse

## What if you are on a mac?

- placeholder

## Historical progression of tooling

- placeholder

## When to shift to other tooling?

- IDE options
- shell options
- linting
- plugins
