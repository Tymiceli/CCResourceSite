# Set Up

Acceptable minimums to get organized for a _**solid bootcamp experience**_

## Are these recommendations or requirements?

_Everything that follows is technically a recommendation until you start asking for help._ Reading that statement, you might be wondering - because that almost sounds like a veiled threat :) As you spend more time in the bootcamp, instead you will find that there is a practical side to the madness of Standards and Conventions.

There is very little in these Setup pages that is "required." You get to do it your way, and sometimes, you should.

When it's time to jump in and get help from your fellow bootcampers, or even from an instructor, _**you may find that things go much faster when you follow standard setups and conventions**_.

That same advice becomes even more practical, once you begin your career as an enterprise developer. Your new employer will almost always require to use its templates and setups.

## Where do Standards/Conventions/Templates Originate?

You may find that most setups in the enterprise java world originate with Maven project configuration standards.

You may also find that these same configurations have been further popularized and standardized via Spring Boot - itself largely based on Maven standards and archetypes.

When it gets down to file structures and templates, the Spring Boot project is the primary source of the standards followed on these templates.

## Standards? or Just Hygiene?

Even if you decide to do things your own way - that is your right - hygiene is your best friend, when working with code.

For example, placing your files in a _**consistent**_ and well understood manner is the kind of hygiene that may keep you from becoming distracted or frustrated as you progress through the course.

Adopting your own naming conventions, or those of others, _**the primary benefit is from having a convention**_ in the first place.

This is the kind of thing that defines "hygiene" within your new work environment.
