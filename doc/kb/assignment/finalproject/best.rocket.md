## Danger Will Robinson! Danger!

Be really careful viewing everything on this page, because it can be easy to become deflated by others who came into the bootcamp with advantages you didn't have, such as certain types of previous experience.

Instead, bring your curiosity and desire to learn. It's totally OK to copy other people's ideas!

More often than not, other students would be delighted to answer questions. Remember - immitation is the sincerest form of flattery.

## Submittals

Please advise (or submit a Pull Request) if your project should have been included on one of these lists below:

## If you are featured below it would help us to have

Or better yet, if you are not featured below and should be please LMK, our students need the best examples they can find!

- Github URL
- What do you have for documentation? Before - and as-built?
- Do you have a screen recording of the demo available?
- Do you have it deployed and working on a public server somewhere such as Heroku?
- What extra stacks did you use besides the usual taught in the bootcamp?
- How do you present this to your prospective employers?
- Do you have tips for bootcampers?

## Best Visual Polish

[something here about Ercan's] and others

## Best Spring Security Implentation

[hmmm this either works or doesn't so would look for someone with polish and or more elaborate role based page protections]

## Best Use of Externally Available APIs

[Niles is best I can think of here. Others?] Need to know how Niles would wish me to describe his work.

## Best Early Planning Process

[Mina for sure] need info from Mina on his ERD and also presentation of plans.

## Most Fearless CRUD JPA

[hmmm not sure might need to review these. Ethan? Niles? Dustin?]

## Best Presentation for Prospective Employers

[Mo] for sure - for the youtube. Then [Tristan] for following up with same.

## Cleanest, Most Well Tested Code

[hmmm no idea on this one]

## Best React or Similar

[hmmm does anyone use anything other than thymeleaf?]

## Best Public Deployment

Dude! Do this if you want to impress your future employer the most! Deploy it on heroku for him to actually use the app!!!

This is [Ethan Brantley's app](http://blue-search.herokuapp.com/)

Or, the github url for the same app's code is [here](https://github.com/EthanLTB/BlueSearch)

If you want to emulate Ethan's success - he said "It did come in handy in my interview though, they seemed to appreciate it" 

Go to go to youtube, search for deploy spring boot app with mysql db on heroku follow one of those and use the Heroku free tier. The video he used was [this one](https://youtu.be/TixLbON3TR8)

And this: "The quirk though is that I kept having version errors on Java, so I eventually just changed my application to run java 8. And it worked."

## Best Technical Stretch w Stacks

[Tristan's web sockets? Ercan's use of a web template? Also several others used tailwind or bootstrap.]
