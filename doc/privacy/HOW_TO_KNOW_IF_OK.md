# How to Know if a File is OK for This Site

This cc/doc site is a public site! So how to know what is OK to be public?

It's a good question, and it goes to the heart of [Coders Campus boot-camp](https://www.coderscampus.com/) as well as just plain old common sense.

1. If it is proprietary to Coders Campus then it does not go here
2. If it is commonly available knowledge, and we are just indexing it here for our own convenience, then putting it here is great.
3. Only Coders Campus gets to decide what is proprietary, so there is your final arbiter in case you are not sure.
