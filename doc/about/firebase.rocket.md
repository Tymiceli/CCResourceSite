# Firebase Deployment

This site is deployed on Firebase

Firebase is not free, but almost free. So far my average bills are either a penny a month or none, usually none.

Firebase is maintained totally by google, so I don't have to maintain a server. And with this I get:

- hosting
- auth (think spring security)
- choice of 2 NOSql databases
- storage (like s3)
- messaging
- serverless javascript functions
- lots of other stuff

It's kind of hard to beat. But the feature I like most is not having to maintain any of this
