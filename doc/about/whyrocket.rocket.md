# Why Rocket?

Only a gluten for punishment even tries to fit this into his/her brain. Not recommended for sane humans:

## Tech Moves Faster than Humans

I took up web components in 2014 because I had been writing abaondonware since 1973, and was tired of being left by the side of the road by obsolete software platforms.

With React and now Svelte coming on so strong, not to mention flavors of native apps such as Flutter, almost all signs are that web components will not take over like I thought.

But I stubbornly hold on to web components, now a fully mature standard.

## Web Components on SSR using Lit - Rocket

Notice I never even explained what web components are, or SSR, even though this could consume (and does, elsewhere) entire sites, just by themselves. Good luck on trying to understand React v web components, or Svelte v standardized web component SSR.

There are too many reasons to cite here for web components on SSR, and even then, this doesn't mean Lit for web components or SSR. "WUT?" you ask.

Lit is google's web component library. And it has an SSR piece. Rocket consumes and packages this.

Rocket is where I think that tech stacks will be headed by 2025. 

## It is still to early to tell

Don't try to understand. There are logic filters and assumptions that took me years to build, and neither of us has the time to waste on these.

I went with Rocket. I think that's where the industry is headed. But I may not be correct. That's OK, I don't think anyone else is making the right guess, either.
