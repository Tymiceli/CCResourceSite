## Scheduling

The General Schedule:

- Monday -> Standards Reps
- Wednesday -> CRUD Reps
- end of week -> Git Reps
- Every checkin, assignment & Team Reps Meeting -> Metrics

Most bootcampers are working other jobs or schooling. So we make the Team Reps schedules as flexible as we possibly can to encourage the widest involvement.
