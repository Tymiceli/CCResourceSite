# Standards Team Reps

Your job interviews, as well as your entire career, depend on not just your ability to do the work of Trevor's lessons and your assignments, but also on your understanding of the coding standards that Trevor built the lessons and assignments around.

Sometimes it takes a lot of discussion to really "get" some of these standards. That's where it helps to have a team to interelate with, and keep bouncing ideas off of each other until it sticks.
