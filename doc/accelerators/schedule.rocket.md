# Scheduling Team Reps

The good news is you get to help negotiate a time that works best for you. We can even build different teams according to who is available when - if demand is high enough.

The bad news is that your team will be counting on you, so if you flake out, your slot goes open after a while. Nobody is 100%, but consistency does matter. So make your time suggestions carefully.

## How To Pick a Time Range

Once you pick a Team Reps option (such as Git or CRUD or Standards) then look up the day. 

Like CRUD Team Reps is Wednesdays - so let's say you really wanted to join a CRUD team. What times am I available on Wednesdays?

Post on Slack "I'd like to join a CRUD Team Reps" if I could find a slot between 7pm EST and 10pm EST Wednesdays"

Then others will be posting also. When there's enough there with a matching time slot, and it works for the instructor, a weekly session will be scheduled.

If your schedule doesn't align with enough bootcampers to make a team, we'll have to keep negotiating until we can figure something out. For example, new students coming in next month might have enough ...

## Sessions limited in size

We don't have enough bootcampers in July 2022 to make this likely, but sometime in the future the more popular time slots might fill up.

Nobody will want to be on a CRUD team with more than 10 regulars, for example.
