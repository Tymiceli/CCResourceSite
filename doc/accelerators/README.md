# Accelerators

Optional beginning in Q3 2022 - Accelerators for CodersCampus bootcampers:

- Team Reps
- Metrics

Accelerate your progress in bootcamp by opting in to either/both of these approaches.

## Potential Benefits:

- Get employed sooner. $$$
- Increased confidence at interview time.
- Feel more solid on the job.
- First raise comes faster.

How do we know that these are possible? Because when our graduates have this extra experience, we have seen one or more of these happen.

So we're making sure every bootcamper has this opportunity.

## Team Reps

- [Git Reps](GIT_REPS.md)
- [CRUD Webapp Reps](CRUD_REPS.md)
- [Standards Reps](STANDARDS_REPS.md)

See expanded version of each of these from the linked pages.

## Team Roles

One thing you'll discover from working on a team, is that it's a lot easier to get your reps in when your in your groove. No matter what types of roles you normally assume within a group dynamic:

- Build a team
- Lead a team
- Join a team
- Support a team

It's not important which role you play. What's important is that you find your approach and make it work for you.

## Scheduling

Generally:

- Monday - Standards Reps
- Wednesday - CRUD Reps
- end of week - Git Reps

Most bootcampers are working other jobs or schooling. So we make the Team Reps schedules as flexible as we possibly can to encourage the widest involvement.
