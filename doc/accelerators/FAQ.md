## Flexible Schedule

It can be confusing but it is still true that - at least to some degree, we can be flexible in our scheduling of these meetings.

How so? It is _**easier for me to adjust as an instructor**_, to the schedule of the highest number of students at a given time, than it is for _them_ to adjust to _my_ schedule.

The much harder part is getting all bootcampers to inform us where there most opportune times are for scheduling a meeting.

We'll never get this right. Even if we find that most people have one best time, others wont be available then. But at least we can try.

Last - and this is really only true about the CRUD Team Meetings - we can have multiple meetings of smaller teams, if enough bootcampers are committed to this course of action. For example, 10 people in one team at 3pm ET, 12 people in another team at 8pm ET.

## Why Optional?

You made a contract to finish a set amount of work to graduate the bootcamp.

Since this extra work would - technically, at least - add to that workload, then it should be optional.

There are questions about whether or not it is actually easier to add a little more in the way of repetition and grounding yourself in the standards. But we'll save that argument for others to make, in the future.
