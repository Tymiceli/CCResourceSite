# Which IDE?

Eclipse is our default IDE - specifically enterprised java version

I definitely open up my projects in both VSCode and Eclipse and even IntelliJ - sometimes at the same time.

VSCode seems just entirely better at all things html/css/javascript

You might want to modify your gitignore file though to not commit all or some of the IDE metadata files

You will definitely be using (Eclipse or Intellij)for your Java if my experience is any judge. I still use VSCode but rarely if ever do I find VSCode suitable for java - Eclipse has had almost 20 years to get better in java.

The paid version of IntelliJ has excellent support also for html/css/javascript but you will find that it is an acquired taste. VSCode makes this a difficult area to compete in.
