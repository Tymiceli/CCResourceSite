# Interview Reps == Standards

Your job interviews, as well as your entire career, depend on _**not just**_ your ability to do the work of Trevor's lessons and your assignments, but _**also on your understanding of the coding standards**_ that Trevor built the lessons and assignments around.

Sometimes it takes a lot of discussion to really "get" some of these standards. That's where it helps to have a team to interelate with, and keep bouncing ideas off of each other until it sticks.

## July 2022 This Is Very New To Us

We know that this is important, we just don't know _yet_ how to make this the most helpful.

So we're going to start out with an iterative approach, and keep adjusting until we get a feel for what works best.

How will we know? By getting feedback. And by how it seems to feel, from a participation perspective. So keep letting us know, and or even better just jump in the conversation and pull it in the direction most helpful to you.
