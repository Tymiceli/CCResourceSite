## What role will I play on the teams?

One thing you'll discover from working on a team, is that it's a lot easier to get your reps in when your in your groove. No matter what types of roles you normally assume within a group dynamic:

- Build a team
- Lead a team
- Join a team
- Support a team

It's not important which role you play. What's important is that you find your approach and make it work for you. 

Negotiate the role you feel most comfortable with.

## Flexible Schedule

It can be confusing but it is still true that - at least to some degree, we can be flexible in our scheduling of these meetings.

How so? It is _**easier for me to adjust as an instructor**_, to the schedule of the highest number of students at a given time, than it is for _them_ to adjust to _my_ schedule.

The much harder part is getting all bootcampers to inform us where there most opportune times are for scheduling a meeting.

We'll never get this right. Even if we find that most people have one best time, others wont be available then. But at least we can try.

Last - and this is really only true about the CRUD Team Meetings - we can have multiple meetings of smaller teams, if enough bootcampers are committed to this course of action. For example, 10 people in one team at 3pm ET, 12 people in another team at 8pm ET.

## Why Optional?

You made a contract to finish a set amount of work to graduate the bootcamp.

Since this extra work would - technically, at least - add extra to that workload, then it should be optional.

It is a possible paradox that repetition at the team level might reduce, rather than increase the cumulative effort required to hit your target of getting a job. Nonetheless, we can't contractually require that because it wouldn't be fair to change the contract after you already signed it.

## Do Team Reps have anything to do with Metrics?

You don't have to do either, or both. In that sense, they are not related. But they ARE complimentary.

Which is to say you can keep excellent metrics of all your work to wow your new employer, without attending a single Team Reps session. Or, the opposite.

But here's the rub, if you do both - even in an incomplete fashion - they reinforce each other.

And few things are more convincing to a prospective employer than reps in the area intended. "I did this thing once" is not as convincing as "I did this thing dozens of times"

## What if my Metrics are incomplete?

Dude! ALL Metrics are incomplete! Here's this story:

Trevor and I were talking one day about all the reps that a bootcamper graduates with, and how almost none are quantified. How many times did you do each of a loop, a variable assignment, a REST call or so many other things? 

If an employer knew these stats, how much better would he view your capabilities?

So the name of this game isn't perfection - you're going to do things here that weren't quantified. The name of this game is to approach a workable summary that would - at minimum - attempt to show you in the best light possible. If you don't get it all, don't sweat it. Good enough is good enough.
