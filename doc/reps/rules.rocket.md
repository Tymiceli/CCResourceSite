# Rules of Engagement for Reps Sessions

Any good game requires an equally good set of rules to manage the enjoyment.

## Why

The very first thing you need is a "Why?".

We do this to gain

- speed
- confidence
- agility
- pleasure

You're going to interview a lot better when you are fast and confident. It's also going to have a positive effect on your first days on the team, first promotion, etc.

## How

We do repetitions to move the memories down to our fingertips.

Also known as "muscle memory," or the same thing you do all the work on your computer or phone with.

## What

So then, what are the rules?

1. We attempt to keep this as fun or enjoyable as possible.
2. **"What starts here, stops here"** No assignments. No expectation to return another day.
3. May do similar thing, many different sessions. And be OK with that.
4. Everybody helps everybody. We all win when receiving OR getting, in this context.

## Side Effects

If we follow these rules, there are lots of good and also questionable side effects.

Like sometimes it can get boring, as with any repetitive task.

This is about being practical.
