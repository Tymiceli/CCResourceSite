# Add a Second Table to CRUD View

This takes the previous task, and adds a second joined table.

Example would be Person & Address table

## Start all over

This project would use totally different table than the first one to force a completely new project with no re-used code.

To facilitate this, it would have different types of objects and schema.

## Examine what kind of logic is required

When you have a separate dependent table:

- how are the CRUD views similar?
- how are the CRUD views different?
