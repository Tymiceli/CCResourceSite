# Interview Drills - 2

These reps help you build a context of lingo that you are expected to understand by your interviewers.

To establish context all assignment levels 1-15 and these sessions, we need a shared language.

For every session we will need to re-establish the same default lingo. These reps reinforce the context where all of our work _"fits"_, within these sessions.
