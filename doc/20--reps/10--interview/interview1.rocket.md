- Can someone who hasn't gone beyond assignment 1 fully participate in these sessions?
- What acronym do we use to describe our Web Apps?

Your job interviews, as well as your entire career, depend on _**not just**_ your ability to do the work of Trevor's lessons and your assignments, but _**also on your understanding of the coding standards**_ that Trevor built the lessons and assignments around.

Sometimes it takes a lot of discussion to really "get" some of these standards. That's where it helps to have a team to interelate with, and keep bouncing ideas off of each other until it sticks.

## July 2022 This Is Very New To Us

We know that this is important, we just don't know _yet_ how to make this the most helpful.

So we're going to start out with an iterative approach, and keep adjusting until we get a feel for what works best.

How will we know? By getting feedback. And by how it seems to feel, from a participation perspective. So keep letting us know, and or even better just jump in the conversation and pull it in the direction most helpful to you.

## Session Archetype Number 1

There is this one class that I keep coming back to because it seems to cover a few dozen things that noobs absolutely HAVE to grasp.

This is about the build and dependency injection and how they became almost sacred processes in the industry over the past couple decades.

It involves libraries but also higher level abstractions resulting from constant train wrecks from 1995 to 2010 and how these train wrecks taught us builds, dependency injection and even newer deployments such as docker and AWS/Azure/GCP etc.

To run this I keep quizzing along the lines of our coursework (Spring, Maven etc) and then expand those into questions of how they became important and what questions your interviewer might have derived that from. How does this differ from our assignments? What motivates the interviewer in his line of questioning?
